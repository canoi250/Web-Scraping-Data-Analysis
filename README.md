# Web Scraping Data Analysis
In this project I have requested data from https://covid19api.com/ and analyzed COVID 19 data to find the total number of confirmed cases in the USA and find the country that has the most number of COVID deaths. 
In part 2, I have requested air quality data from https://www.epa.gov/air-quality and have analyzed that data.  
In part 3, I have requested scraped from a website on guitar pedals, and created a table to convey all the relevant information. 
In part 4, I have scraped data from a sports website: https://www.espn.com/nfl/schedule and stored the information in a dataframe.
